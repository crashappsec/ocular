# Controller Design

The controller is a crucial component of our system, responsible for managing the lifecycle of resources and ensuring
that the desired state is maintained. This document outlines the design principles, architecture, and implementation
details of the controller.
It is responsible for both reconciling resources and managing webhooks, which are essential for validating and mutating
resources during their creation or update.

## Resource Reconciliation and Webhooks actions

| Resource          | Reconciler                                                      | Create Admission Webhook                                                                                              | Update Admission Webhook                                                              | Delete Admission Webhook                                                                      |
