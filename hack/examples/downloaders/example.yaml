# A downloader represents a container to run for a given target,
# that will "download" the targets static assets. A target is defined by
# an identifier (e.g. a git repo URL) and a version (e.g. a git commit SHA).
# The downloader will be feed these values as environment variables (e.g. OCULAR_TARGET_IDENTIFIER and OCULAR_TARGET_VERSION)
# and should write the assets to the target directory /mnt/target (or the value of the environment variable TARGET_DIR).
# When a pipeline is created for a target, the user additionally specifies which
# downloader to run for the target.
