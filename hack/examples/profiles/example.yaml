# Each scanner will be a container in the same pod as the downloader.
# The downloader will run first and write the static assets to the
# target directory /mnt/target (or the value of the environment variable TARGET_DIR).
# After the downloader finishes, the scanners will run in parallel with their working
# directory set to the target directory.
